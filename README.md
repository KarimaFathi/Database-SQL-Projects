## Problem 01 : Create Master View

The purpose of this task is to create a database view that centralizes vehicle data by joining the VehicleDetails table with its related lookup tables. The view includes all ID columns along with their corresponding descriptive names (such as make, model, submodel, body, drive type, and fuel type), providing a single, clear dataset that simplifies querying and improves readability.

## Problem 02 : Filter Vehicles (2000–2020)

The task is to retrieve all vehicles manufactured between 2000 and 2020 by filtering the data based on the Year column.


## Problem 03 : Count Vehicles (2000–2020)

The task is to count all vehicles manufactured between 2000 and 2020 by filtering the data based on the Year column.


## Problem 04 : Count Vehicles by Make (2000–2020)

The task is to calculate the number of vehicles manufactured between 2000 and 2020 for each make and orders the results by the total number of vehicles in descending order.


## Problem 05 : List Vehicle Counts per Make with Total

The task is to retrieve the number of vehicles produced for each make between 2000 and 2020, and display the overall vehicle count for the same period alongside each result, ordered by vehicle count.


## Problem 06 : Filter and Rank Makes by Vehicle Production (2000–2020)

The task is to determine the number of vehicles produced by each make between 2000 and 2020, including only those makes with 2,700 vehicles or more, and to sort the results in descending order by the total number of vehicles.

## Problem 07 : Calculate Vehicle Percentage by Make

The task is to compute the number of vehicles produced by each make between 2000 and 2020, calculate each make’s share as a percentage of the total vehicles in that period, and display the results ordered by the number of vehicles.

## Problem 08 : List Vehicles by Make and Fuel Type (2000–2020)

The task is to retrieve the number of vehicles manufactured between 2000 and 2020, grouped by make and fuel type, and display the results ordered by make name.
