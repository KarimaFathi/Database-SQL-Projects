## Problem 01 : Create Master View

The purpose of this task is to create a database view that centralizes vehicle data by joining the VehicleDetails table with its related lookup tables. The view includes all ID columns along with their corresponding descriptive names (such as make, model, submodel, body, drive type, and fuel type), providing a single, clear dataset that simplifies querying and improves readability.
